/*
 Visibility Priority describes the priority at which a view should be held (aka, not be detached).
 In the case that clippingResistancePriority is optional (< NSLayoutPriorityRequired) and there's not enough space to display all of StackView's subviews, views are able to be detached from the StackView.
 Views will be detached in order (from lowest to highest) of their visibility priority, and reattached in the reverse order (FILO).
 If multiple views share the lowest visibility priority, all those views will be dropped when one needs to be. Likewise, groups of views with equal visibility priorities will wait to be reattached until they can all be readded.

 A view with a higher visibility priority will never be detached while a lower priority view remains visible
